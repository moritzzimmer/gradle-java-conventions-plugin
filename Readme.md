Gradle Java Conventions Plugin ![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/WeltN24/gradle-java-conventions-plugin/branch/master/build_image)
==============================

This plugin applies best practices and conventions for developing Java based microservices at [welt](https://github.com/WeltN24).

## Usage

See [plugin portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/de.weltn24.java-conventions).

## Preconditions
- currently this plugin supports only Java projects using JDK 8 and git
- plugin tested with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) 2.4+ in single and multi project setups
- plugin tested with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) 14.1+

## Conventions

### Project

The following standard Gradle plugins will be applied automatically:

+ [java](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html)
+ [idea](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/idea_plugin.html)
+ [eclipse](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/eclipse_plugin.html)
+ [jacoco](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html)

Furthermore  the [jcenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) repository is configured for dependency resolution.

### Java

All compile tasks are configured to use **UTF-8** encoding and [incremental](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html) compilation.

### Tests

#### Pyramid

Inspired by Martin Fowlers [proposal](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/) for combining testing strategies to get a high coverage, custom source sets, configurations and tasks are configured in addition to the build-in unit test setup:

1. Integration tests: *An integration test verifies the communication paths and interactions between components to detect interface defects.*
2. Component tests: *A component test limits the scope of the exercised software to a portion of the system under test, manipulating the system through internal code interfaces and using test doubles to isolate the code under test from other components.*
3. Smoke tests: Used during blue/green deployment for quickly checking the health of the new service version before switching.

Using those configurations it's possible to configure distinct dependencies for the different test strategies. Example:

    integrationTestCompile(
      'com.jayway.jsonpath:json-path:2.0.0'
    )
    smokeTestCompile(
      'com.jayway.restassured:rest-assured:2.4.1'
    )

| Strategy | Configurations | Task | Source Set |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
|Integration tests| integrationTestCompile, integrationTestRuntime| integrationTest| integrationTest |
|Component tests| componentTestCompile, componentTestRuntime| componentTest| componentTest |
|Smoke tests| smokeTestCompile, smokeTestRuntime| *smokeTest| smokeTest |

*smokeTest: This task will only run when `SMOKETEST_SUT` (URL to the system under test) is configured as an environment variable or `STAGE` is defined as JVM property. JVM properties `STAGE` and `SMOKETEST_SUT` will be forwarded to the smokeTest execution JVM.

All custom configurations extend the test scope and have access to the production code. Furthermore integration and component tests are configured to be executed during *check* task of the Java plugin. Run *gradlew tasks* for more information.

#### Parallel unit test execution

It's possible to enable parallel execution of unit tests

| Type | Name | Default Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
|bool| runTestsParallel| false| On/Off switch for parallel unit testing |
|int| testThreads | Runtime.runtime.availableProcessors()/2 | number of workers for test runs |

Example:

    project.weltn24JavaConventions {
        runTestsParallel = true
        testThreads = 4
    }

#### JaCoCo agent

The default tool version of the [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/agent.html) can be set in the target project.

| Type | Name | Default Value | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |
|String| jacocoVersion| "0.7.5.201505241946"| sets a specified version of JaCoCo java agent in your project |

Example:

    project.weltn24JavaConventions {
        jacocoVersion = '0.7.4.201502262128'
    }

## Testing

Testing the functionality of the plugin during the development can be achieved manually by executing the following steps:

 1. Publish your new changes to your local maven repository with `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` (don't forget to increment the version number)
 2. Add the local Maven cache as a repository in an another gradle project than can integrate with the plugin:

    ```
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenLocal()
        }
    }
    ```

 3. Use the updated version of the plugin as a local dependency with the gradle project from the step before and run the plugin

### IDEA

Language level and JDK will be configured to *Java 1.8* the VCS is set to *git*.

## Publishing

Publishing is automatically done by [SnapCI](https://snap-ci.com/WeltN24/gradle-java-conventions-plugin/branch/master) after a commit with increased version.
